# Doctor_Handwritting_Recognition
This Project is a exploratory project using a small sample dataset to study if one can use CNN Models to understand and identify the medicine prescribed by a doctor.

The Dataset used here is a custom dataset of one doctor

Note: Here the approach was to identify word by word and there by identify the name of the medicine

## Conclusion
- The model performed well on the small sample of dataset - some letters where missing rare usage of letters in medicine names
- Note the medicine prescribed where brand names of the medicine rather than the generic name
- In practise it will be very difficult to seperate out the letters when the writting is continous there by limiting the usage only cases where letters can be serperated cleanly
